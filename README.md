# IoT-Satisfaction-meassurement

The project involves the development of a wireless satisfaction survey tool that receives user input and analyzes citizens' satisfaction with Aarhus Kommune's customer service. The prototype sends data via MQTT to a database and displays the database content on a web browser. The project uses a physical network and is based on Raspberry Pi 4 and Raspberry Pi Pico as solution platforms.

The purpose of the project is to demonstrate that the group members have understood theory and practice and can implement their knowledge into a finished product that combines the disciplines of Embedded Systems, Networking, Programming, and Project Management.
